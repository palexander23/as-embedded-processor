# Basic Test Program
# This is the program that is run by the basic testbench for the CPU
# It tests each instruction individually.
# It does not run the program given in the spec.

# Test ACCI function ACC write
ACCI %0 %1 45                       # Set ACC to 45
ACCI %0 %1 -12                      # Set ACC to -12

# Test ACCI function SW[7:0] load 
ACCI %2 %1 2                        # Load SW[7:0] into %2
ACCI %23 %1 3                        # Load SW[7:0] into %3

# Test MACI function
MACI %0 %2 6                        # ACC should go to -12 + 6*4 = 0
MACI %0 %3 5                        # ACC should go to 0 + 3*5 = 15

# Test wait on SW[8]
BEQ %0 %1 0                         # Hold until SW[8] goes to not 0
BNE %0 %1 0                         # Hold until SW[8] goes to 0
